## Description
This project implemented many different Javascript and API concepts. Some concepts include timers, creating DOM elements through JS instead of HTML, and saving content to local storage. In addition, I had to understand JS Objects and Arrays in order to push new names and scores as Objects into Arrays and then save these into localStorage. Moreover, I had to use JSON.stringify and JSON.parse methods to save and access the localStorage items.

## Features
The quiz presented has fully functioning buttons and hyperlinks. The 'Go Back' and 'Clear High Scores' buttons take a user back to the start of the quiz and clear the high scores table. Additionally, the 'View high scores' hyperlink takes the user to the high score table regardless of where they are in the quiz. This is done by clearing child elements in the DOM and recreating the DOM structure of the high score page. The quiz questions and choices are also generated by JS and going through an array.
